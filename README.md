# The North Star

The current market offers amazing developer tools such as Morails, Web3Auth, Magic, and many more, for simplifying development for decentrailized applications (dApp). However, majority of the developer tools provides a very fragmented experience where developers need to stich together APIs (often more than 10 APIs to deliver a simple feature in a crypto wallet app), or make compromises to highly-restrictive SDKs, or hack ways around to integrate with lagacy systems. Although this is fairly common in the web2 world, but our team does not believe solving the web3 challenges require a complex solution. This means no more confusing over-engineered APIs, rigid SDKs, or vendor-locking. 

Introducing the `Masma web3 Services`, we are building the most vertically-integrated engineering platform to build, test, expand softwares with web3 capabilities. Our platform is designed to simplify the technology stack when incorporating web3 technologies, helping you and your team to unlock, experiment and deliver value faster and more efficiently than ever before.

We offer identity driven building blocks in which every internet identity automatically associate with custodial/non-custodial wallets (EOA/Legacy Contract/ERC-4337). We give back the power to developers to customize the user experience without compromises via a sinlge vertically integrated GraphQL API. Developers can leverage out- of the box Identity & Access Management (IAM) System to manage Wallets and user identity, or bring any OIDC/SAML compatible identity providers. We believe that a single vertically integrated interface combined with industry standard identity approach (OIDC/SAML) delivers the most cohesive developer experience and flexibility that addresses the major pain points in building web3 capable softwares. 

Masma services removes the cognitive load of blockchain, allowing teams to focus on building the best product experience without worrying about the underlying complex infrastructures and knowledge barriers. Whether you‚Äôre building your hobby project or the next disruptive application that will onboard millions of users, our services are tailored to meet your unique needs and growth stage.

# Engineering Mission:

Masma Web3 Services platform is dedicated to empowering developers to build innovative software solutions that leverage the power of web3 technologies. Our mission is to create cutting-edge developer tools that simplify the development process and enable developers to create next-generation applications that are more secure, transparent, and accessible to all.

we prioritize collaboration, transparency, and continuous learning from the community. We value open communication and encourage everyone to share their ideas and insights freely. We also invest in our customer‚Äôs success as much as in Masma platform to ensure the the shared success in our engineering community.

# Feature Prioritization with R.I.C.E

<aside>
üí°

The R.I.C.E. method is a prioritization framework used in product management to help teams decide which features or ideas to work on next. R.I.C.E. stands for Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, and each of these factors is scored on a scale of 1 to 10 to determine the priority of a given feature or idea.

</aside>

## Cooking R.I.C.E ‚ÄúRecipe‚Äù

- **Reach**: How many people will this feature or idea impact? This factor looks at the potential user base for a given feature or idea.
- **Impact**: How much will this feature or idea impact users? This factor looks at the potential benefit or positive impact of a given feature or idea.
- **Confidence**: How confident are we in the data we're using to make this decision? This factor looks at the level of uncertainty or risk associated with a given feature or idea.
- **Effort**: How much time and resources will it take to build and launch this feature or idea? This factor looks at the level of effort required to bring a given feature or idea to market.

## How do we use it for Masma?

By scoring each of these factors on a scale of 1 to 10 and multiplying the scores for Reach, Impact, and Confidence, and dividing that product by the score for Effort, teams can arrive at an overall R.I.C.E. score for a given feature or idea. This score can be used to prioritize which features or ideas to work on next, with higher-scoring items typically being prioritized over lower-scoring ones.
